# Covid_19_Project_Azure_Databricks_ADF
A data engineering solution using Azure Databricks and Azure Data Factory (ADF) for a real world problem of reporting Covid-19 trends and prediction of the spread of this virus.
Azure Data Factory

Building a solution architecture for a data engineering solution using Azure Data Engineering technologies such as Azure Data Factory (ADF), Azure Data Lake Gen2, Azure Blob Storage, Azure SQL Database, Azure Databricks, Azure HDInsight and Microsoft PowerBI.

Integrating data from HTTP clients, Azure Blob Storage and Azure Data Lake Gen2 using Azure Data Factory.

Branching and Chaining activities in Azure Data Factory (ADF) Pipelines using control flow activities such as Get Metadata. If Condition, ForEach, Delete, Validation etc.

Using Parameters and Variables in Pipelines, Datasets and LinkedServices to create a metadata driven pipelines in Azure Data Factory (ADF)

Debugging the data pipelines and resolving issues.

Scheduling pipelines using triggers such as Event Trigger, Schedule Trigger and Tumbling Window Trigger in Azure Data Factory (ADF)

Creating Mapping Data Flows to create transformation logic. The course covers all of the transformation steps such as Source, Filter, Select, Pivot, Lookup, Conditional Split, Derived Column, Aggregate, Join and Sink transformation.

Debugging data flows, investigating issues, fixing failures etc

Implementing Azure Data Factory pipelines to invoke Mapping Data Flows and executing them.

Creating ADF pipelines to execute HDInsight activities and carry out data transformations.

Creating ADF pipelines to execute Databricks Notebook activities to carry out transformations.

Creating dependency between pipelines to orchestrate the data flow

Creating dependency between triggers to orchestrate the data flow

Monitoring data pipelines, creating alerts, reporting of metrics from the Azure Data Factory Monitor.

Monitoring of Data Factory pipelines using Azure Monitor and setting diagnostic setting to be forwarded to Azure Storage Account or Log Analytics Workspace.

Creating Log Analytics workspace, creating workbooks and charts from log analytics on the Azure Data Factory pipelines

Implementing the Azure Data Factory Analytics monitoring tool and how to extend the capability further.
